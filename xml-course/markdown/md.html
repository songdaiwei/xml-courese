        change the website for log and problem and summary, replaced by the html trasnformed from README markdown file. 
        try to input the xml data by spider from douban.
        thanks to [CuiBinghua](https://github.com/CuiBinghua/douban_list_spider)
Mar 27:

        code for the XSL-FO and find the hardness of the NavigatableString in bs4 of spider.
  
  
Mar 28:

        nearly finish the XSL-FO and generate the pdf file.
        
        
## Problem:

		- my xsd and dtd are on the github.com. how can I refer them in xml?
		- I will transfer this web to [coding.net](https://coding.net/u/yvonshong/p/xml_course/git) to check the dtd and schema.
        - in order to modufy the web of next.html to show our plan to sync this README.md, we will use the Pandoc to try to transfer the markdown file to html file.
       

##Summary:

        - iframe
        iframe is hard to be adaptive and to modularize. and there are some errors of link jumping. nestification and modularization are hard by html.
		- sync
         Git plus OneDrive are convenient for two computer which are used by the only one person.
		 the editor for web like sublime text, vs code. I find the vs code integrate the Git.
        - tools
